# A Special backhanded thanks:
To Hakita. Your discord deserves trolls because you are a pathetic noided admin for very few if any good reasons, whom routinely permabans friends of mine for imagined slights against you, and rules so incredibly vague you can break them with a sneeze.

On the other hand Hakita, I love your work, and your game Ultrakill SO GOD DAMN MUCH, that even when you banned me for ping-quoting people and not taking warns for it seriously in a pre-Reply-function age of discord, I still bought 5 of my friends ultrakill, and bought your game myself even though I couldve kept braving the high seas in response. 

## Why do i make a fuss about it even though it was a year ago? 
When im wondering why the bar was so low to get banned, and asking Rayka what happened, he tells me YOU thought that just because I made fun of how stupid it was to penalize ping quoting meant I was suddenly going to "start posting gore and edgy racial stuff next". And that is deserving of shame and what solidifies my UNDESIRE to rejoin the guild even with an alt & VPN. 

Above all else - rather than further pursue your rancid guild, your ability to bring joy to my heart in the form of Ultrakill inspired me to commission these scripts in homage to you. Fuck you. I love you. Unlike YanDev you are a sheltered individual actually capable of putting out the best banger I have ever layed hands on. The best banger ANYONE has layed hands on. And everyone who loved working on these E2s also has you to thank.
