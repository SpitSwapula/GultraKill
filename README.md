# GultraKill
A combined repository of Ultracoin and Ultramove. Distribution release.

# Ultracoin
An Expression2 script that ports Ultrakill's Marksman/coinshot ability to Garry's Mod

An overwhelming majority of this code is written by the lovely Katsu (Especially the beautiful holos and the algebraic functions relating to hit detection and grazing shots. Oh and the entirety of the movement script.)

Slam Storage, Dash Jumping, and Dash rebalance done by GoldenFlare

WhitelistBlacklist, coinpunt tech, and momentum imparted tossing done by the lovely Heckteck

Antispam by Runic

minor miscellanious tweaks to coin values done by the lovely Omni, Myself, Gamerweed69 and GoldenFlare

# Installation
Just clone in, SSH, or pull the zip file.

Drop Ultracoin.txt into ProgramFiles/Steam/Steamapps/Common/GarrysMod/garrysmod/data/expression2

Same for Ultramove.txt

But put V1PAC3 into the pac3 folder    Steam/Steamapps/Common/GrarrysMod/garrysmod/data/pac3

# Intallation Explained
First make sure you have Wiremod, Plycore, Antcore and Nexuscore installed through the workshop.

Propcore is already inside of Wiremod but must be enabled by commandline.

Download ultracoin as a zip file using the "code" dropdown in github, colored as a green box.

If opening Garry'sMod directory through steam, right click the game in the library, go to properties, local files, browse local files. Then navigate the folders to get to "Garry'sMod/garrysmod/data/expression2"

Place the script text files into the expression2 folder.

If your game was already running, open the wire tab of your spawnmenu, open the Expression2 tool, and click "update" to refresh all available script listings so that the recently added scripts now show up.

Both Ultracoin and Ultramove go into the steam/steamapps/common/Garrys Mod/garrysmod/data/expression2 
Folder

But the PAC3 file included in ultramove.zip needs to be placed into Garrys Mod/garrysmod/data/pac3


A few necessary in-game console commands are

wire_holograms_modelany 1

wire_expression2_extension_enable propcore

wire_expression2_concmd 1

The first command allows the new vfx for coinshot to show, the second allows it to even work, and the third allows the movement E2 to play the PAC's sliding animation on your playermodel

# To use

Ultracoin:

Right click when holding 357 to toss coin, up to 4 times. After a slight delay, you can shoot your coin. Struck coins will target other coins and players.

If someone else chucked a coin, shoot it before they can to totally meme them.

Coins will recharge over time and you will receive a notification.

Add players to blacklist and whitelist so you can choose who is targetted.

Coins can be punted with Gravity Gun for extra range

################################################################################################################################

Ultramove:

Dash with your sprint key up to 3 times before 1 use recharges every 1 second.

Slam by using your crouch key when airborne.

Slide by holding your crouch key while on the ground. You will begin sliding in the direction you are looking if not moving. If moving, you will slide in last held movement direction.

#Advanced Usage
Ultramove:

Slam Storage can be performed by slamming into a simultaneous walljump, and then pressing & holding jump key when touching ground. This will throw you into the stratusphere.

Slide Hopping can be performed by starting a slide then jumping shortly after. On Sanctuary, looking behind where you are sliding before jumping will yield greater velocity.

Dash Hopping can be performed by jumping mid-dash, sending you a great distance.
